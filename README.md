# Virtual-Arts-Coding-Challenge


I was given a 48 hour coding challenge by Virtual Arts, this is what I produced.

## Requirements

- Be able to select a 3D shape and place it into an environment.

- Be able to edit, configure and move the placed objects and shapes.

- Be able to delete/remove placed objects and shapes from the environment.

## How to try it?

Download and unzip the zip file to access the pre-built version

## More explaination?

I demo the application, explain the requirements, and walk through some of the code here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHcAjDBpIpU
